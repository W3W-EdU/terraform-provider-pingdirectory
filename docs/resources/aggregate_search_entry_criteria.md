# pingdirectory_aggregate_search_entry_criteria (Resource)

Manages a Aggregate Search Entry Criteria.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=1.1"
  required_providers {
    pingdirectory = {
      version = "~> 0.3.0"
      source  = "pingidentity/pingdirectory"
    }
  }
}

provider "pingdirectory" {
  username   = "cn=administrator"
  password   = "2FederateM0re"
  https_host = "https://localhost:1443"
  # Warning: The insecure_trust_all_tls attribute configures the provider to trust any certificate presented by the PingDirectory server.
  # It should not be used in production. If you need to specify trusted CA certificates, use the
  # ca_certificate_pem_files attribute to point to any number of trusted CA certificate files
  # in PEM format. If you do not specify certificates, the host's default root CA set will be used.
  # Example:
  # ca_certificate_pem_files = ["/example/path/to/cacert1.pem", "/example/path/to/cacert2.pem"]
  insecure_trust_all_tls = true
  product_version        = "9.2.0.0"
}

resource "pingdirectory_aggregate_search_entry_criteria" "myAggregateSearchEntryCriteria" {
  id = "MyAggregateSearchEntryCriteria"
}

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Name of this object.

### Optional

- `all_included_search_entry_criteria` (Set of String) Specifies a search entry criteria object that must match the associated search result entry in order to match the aggregate search entry criteria. If one or more all-included search entry criteria objects are provided, then a search result entry must match all of them in order to match the aggregate search entry criteria.
- `any_included_search_entry_criteria` (Set of String) Specifies a search entry criteria object that may match the associated search result entry in order to match the aggregate search entry criteria. If one or more any-included search entry criteria objects are provided, then a search result entry must match at least one of them in order to match the aggregate search entry criteria.
- `description` (String) A description for this Search Entry Criteria
- `none_included_search_entry_criteria` (Set of String) Specifies a search entry criteria object that must not match the associated search result entry in order to match the aggregate search entry criteria. If one or more none-included search entry criteria objects are provided, then a search result entry must not match any of them in order to match the aggregate search entry criteria.
- `not_all_included_search_entry_criteria` (Set of String) Specifies a search entry criteria object that should not match the associated search result entry in order to match the aggregate search entry criteria. If one or more not-all-included search entry criteria objects are provided, then a search result entry must not match all of them (that is, it may match zero or more of them, but it must not match all of them) in order to match the aggregate search entry criteria.
